# Brazier

This module acts as the game simulator for the AI module [AlphaHearth](../AlphaHearth). Most of the work comes from [Kelemen](https://github.com/kelemen)'s original version of [Brazier](https://github.com/HearthSim/Brazier), but great changes have been made for a better using experience.
