Yes, this project is named after the famous AlphaGo.

As a MCTS AI for Hearthstone, AlphaHearth is still under construction. It uses a greatly changed version of
[Brazier](https://github.com/HearthSim/Brazier) as its game simulator, which provides a better API, naming
consistency and documentation than the original version. For more information, see the [Brazier](Brazier) module.
